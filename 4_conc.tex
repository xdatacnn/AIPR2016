\section{Conclusion}
The conclusion goes here.
%we have analyzed large datasets of x-ray scattering data (HipGISAXS), as in Figure 2, running on massively parallel machines, and, more generally, analysis of image-based experiments for quantifying material composition and structures (e.g. QuantCT/IDEAL), exploring graph-based methods. Finally, we will discuss how these images across domains can be processed using similar tools and/or motifs, and how higher levels of concurrency promoted by new computing systems may provide online feedback to steer experiments and collect more information from data.
