\section{Convolutional neural networks}
In this section, we introduce the proposed Convolutional Neural Networks algorithms used for scientific image exploration and understanding under four modalities
, which consists of three main

why different science problems are being attached by different algorithms? Are there differences in the architecture of these different algorithms?
