\begin{abstract}
Electron and X-ray interactions with matter can be recorded as digital images, which is often the only mean by which scientists can investigate microstructure of materials. The recent ability to quickly acquire large datasets at high resolution has created new challenges in areas that rely upon image-based information. The proposed analytical schemes adopt Convolutional Neural Networks as a core algorithm in the reconnaissance of expected events from data gathered in two regimes: experimentally and by simulation. At the convergence of physical and digital datasets, we propose classification schemes that exploit complex geometrical structure from scientific images through different machine learning packages, such as MatConvNet and TensorFlow. Our results show accuracy classification rates over 90\% considering thousands to millions of samples from four image modalities: cryo-electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray scattering and X-ray microtomography.
